When I was young I'd listen to the radio
Waiting for my favorite songs
When they played, I'd sing along
It made me smile
Those were such happy times and not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again, just like a long lost
friend
All the songs I loved so well
Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-wo-wo still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That they're startin' to sing, so fine
When they get to the part
Where he's breaking her heart
It can really make me cry just like before
It's yesterday once more
(Shoo be do lang lang)
(Shoo be do lang lang)
Looking back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed
It was songs of love that I would sing to them
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away
Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-wo-wo still shines
(Oldie, oldies but goodies)
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That they're startin' to sing, so fine
All my best memories
Come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry just like before
It's yesterday once more
(Shoo be do lang lang)
Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-wo-wo still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That they're startin' to sing, so fine
Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-wo-wo still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That they're startin' to sing, so fine
