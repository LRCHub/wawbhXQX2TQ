When I was young
I'd listen to the radio
Waiting for my favorite songs
When they played I'd sing along
It made me smile
Those were such happy times
and not so long ago
How I wondered
where they've gone
But they're back again
just like a long lost friend
All the songs I loved so well
Every sha lalala
every woo still shines
Every sing a ling a ling
that they're starting to sing
so fine
When they get to the part
where he's breaking her heart
It can really make me cry
Just like before
It's yesterday once more
Looking back on how
it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed
It was songs of love
that I would sing to then
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies
still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away
Every sha lalala
every woo still shines
Every sing a ling a ling
that they're starting to sing
so fine All my best memories
come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry
just like before
It's yesterday once more
Every sha lalala
every woo still shines
Every sing a ling a ling
that they're starting to sing
so fine Every sha lalala
every woo still shines
